# Branch Protection (GitHub → Settings)
1. Protect default branch (require PR, linear history, up-to-date).
2. Required status checks: ci, policy-lint, ai-review.
3. Require ≥1 approval from non-author; dismiss stale approvals on new commits.
4. Add CODEOWNERS for sensitive paths.
5. Optional: require signed commits; enable auto-merge labels.
